Soup Raiders: Jailbreak is a standalone Game Boy homebrew rom, set in the Soup Raiders universe.

You control Black Whiskers, who was captured with his friend, White Fur, and who was locked up in the deepest Mr. Whale's cell.

Escape by finding the keys, while White Fur is patiently standing still. Come on, she won't wait all day!
